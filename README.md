# CSE 373 Homework

You'll use this Git repository for all homework assignments in this class.

This project is meant to be imported into IntelliJ as a Gradle project.

You are not expected to understand the contents of any Gradle-related files, 
and may safely ignore them---if you encounter issues with project setup, please
seek help from the course staff.

See [the homework page on the course website](https://cs.uw.edu/373/homework/)
for more instructions.

(In theory, it should be possible to complete our projects using the Gradle 
support in any other IDE or by using Gradle without an IDE, but the course 
staff may not be able to provide technical support if you do so.)
